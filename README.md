Spectra.jl is a package aimed at helping spectroscopic (Raman, Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, XAS...) data treatment under Julia. Spectra.jl aim is to provide a simplest way to perform actions like baseline fitting and removal, or peak fitting for instance, while respecting the freedom offered by data treatment through using a computer code instead of a Graphic User Interface.

# Installation

In Julia 1.0 and later, use the `pkg` environment (key `]`), then directly run `add Spectra`.

*If you don't already have PyCall installed, or are getting errors with regards to Spectra not being able to find rampy, run the following:
```
pkg] add PyCall
julia> using PyCall
julia> @pyimport pip
julia> pip.main(["install","rampy"])
```
