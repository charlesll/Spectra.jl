# Peak fitting

## Introduction

Spectra allows to fit a spectrum with a sum of peaks, of different shapes. For that, we rely on the peak shape functions [`gaussian`](@ref), [`lorentzian`](@ref), [`pseudovoigt`](@ref) and [`pearson7`](@ref). Using those, you can generate a signal given `x`, and peak parameters. To generate a signal composed of multiple contributions from different peaks, use the [`create_peaks`](@ref) function. It is a useful function for instance to create "fake" signals and test our peak fitting function, [`fit_peaks`](@ref). 

[`fit_peaks`](@ref) uses either Optim.jl or a custom quasi-Newton algorithm to fit the sum of the peaks `` y_{calc} `` to an observed signal `` y `` affected by errors `` \sigma_y ``. The regression also takes into account *Ã  priori* errors `` \sigma_{m_{prior}} `` on prior model parameters `` m_{prior} ``: we assume a Gaussian *prior* on model parameters with a mean ``m_{prior}`` and a covariance matrix ``C_M`` which diagonal contains ``\sigma_{m_{prior}}^2``.

Given the forward calculation of `` y_{calc} `` as
```math
y_{calc} = g(m)
```

with ``m`` the model parameters and `g` the forward model, the misfit function ``S`` is ([Tarantola 2005](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898717921), chapter 3, eq. 3.46):

```math
S(m) = \frac{1}{2}[(y - y_{calc})^{t} C_D^{-1}(y - y_{calc}) + (m - m_{prior})^{t}C_M^{-1}(m-m_{prior})]
```

where ``C_D^{-1}`` is the inverse of the data covariance matrix, which diagonal contains ``\sigma_y^2``. The misfit function is related to the posterior probability density in the model space following ``K \exp (-S(m))``, with ``K`` a constant. Here, we are dealing with a non-linear problem so this posterior probability density is not Gaussian. However, we assume that it can be linearized near ``m_{prior}``. Therefore, starting close to or at ``m_{prior}``, we can use the following quasi-Newton algorithm to find a suitable solution (Tarantola 2005, eq. 3.51):

```math
m_{n+1} = m_{n} - \mu_n(G_n^tC_D^{-1}G_n + C_M^{-1})^{-1}(G_n^tC_D^{-1}(y_{calc, n} - y) + C_M^{-1}(m_n - m_{prior}))
```

where `` y_{calc, n} `` is the model output at iteration `` n `` with the set of parameters `` m_n ``, `` (G_n)^i_\alpha = (\frac{g^i}{m^\alpha})_{m_n} `` is the matrix of partial derivatives, and ``\mu_n`` a step size typically lower or equal to 1. In `fit_peaks`, the two parameters `maxiter` and `relax` control the maximum number of iterations `n` and the step size `` \mu_n ``, with `` \mu_n = \frac{1}{\text{relax}} ``.

The other available method is the Interior Point Newton algorithm from [Optim.jl](https://julianlsolvers.github.io/Optim.jl/stable/algo/ipnewton/) (`:Optim` backend). This method implements an interior-point primal-dual Newton algorithm for solving the nonlinear, constrained optimization problem. In other terms, it allows the use of constraints, such as parameter boundaries. This is the main difference with the quasi-Newton method. The misfit function that is minimized is the ``S(m)`` function provided above.

Convergence between the two methods usually is similar, with the quasi-Newton method being slightly faster. However, as there is no boundaries on parameters, one may have problems for instance if the intensity of one peak is close to 0. The quasi-Newton method offers no boundaries for the parameter values, contrary to the Interior Point Newton method. 

## Fitting procedure

A short example probably is better than many worlds. We are going to fit a synthetic signal that we created ourselves with the following code:

```@example 1
using Plots
using Spectra
using Statistics

# The X axis
x = collect(0:0.2:100)

# The "perfect" Y signal
y_perfect = (
    gaussian(x, [10.0, 35.0, 10.0]) +
    lorentzian(x, [15.0, 55.0, 3.0]) +
    pearson7(x, [20.0, 45.0, 2.0, 0.4])
)
# Of course, in real world we have noise, here it is Gaussian
noise = randn(length(x))*0.3

# This is what we observe and want to fit
y_obs = y_perfect + noise

# Let's visualize it!
p1 = plot(x, [y_perfect, y_obs]; labels=["The true signal" "Observations"])
savefig("fit_1.svg"); nothing #hide
```
![](fit_1.svg)

First, you define a vector containing named vectors of peak types, ``m_{prior}``, ``\sigma_{m_{prior}}``, and lower and upper boundaries. For instance, after a visual review of the signal above, you would declare a vector of peak informations like this:

```@example 1
# (peak_type, m_prior, sigma_m_prior, lower_bounds, upper_bounds)
peaks_info = [
    (   
        :gaussian, # peak_type
        [10.5, 30.0, 11.0], # m_prior (intensity, position, hwhm)
        [5.0, 5.0, 3.0], # sigma_m_prior
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # lower_bounds
        [Inf, Inf, 50.0]), # upper_bounds
    (
        :lorentzian, # peak_type
        [17.5, 54.0, 3.1], # m_prior (intensity, position, hwhm)
        [5.0, 3.0, 1.0], # sigma_m_prior
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # lower_bounds
        [Inf, Inf, Inf], # upper_bounds
    ),
    (
        :pearson7, # peak_type
        [21.5, 44.0, 3.0, 0.4], # m_prior (intensity, position, hwhm, shape exponent)
        [3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 0.02], # sigma_m_prior
        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # lower_bounds
        [100.0, 100.0, 50.0, Inf], # upper_bounds
    ),
]
```
!!! note

    Upper and lower boundaries for model parameters are always required when constructing this peaks information vector. However, remember that they are not used in the quasi-Newton method.

We then pass the data and this vector of peak informations to [`prepare_context`](@ref) that stores everything in a Julia object. In addition to `peaks_info`, you will need the data vectors `x`, `y_obs`, and the errors on `y_obs`. Usually we do not have a precise idea of those errors. A good approximation can be provided by the difference between the observed signal and a smoothed version. We adopt this approach here and check if the estimated error makes sens:

```@example 1
y_smo = smooth(x, y_obs, method="gcvspline");
estimated_mean_error = sqrt(mean((y_obs .- y_smo).^2))
println("The estimated mean standard error on y_obs is $(round(estimated_mean_error,digits=2))")
```

OK, the result seems to be not too bad. We will place ourselves in a "real world" situation and 
use those errors. For convenience we create an vector of errors

```@example 1
estimated_error = estimated_mean_error * ones(size(x));
```

We can now pass the data and associated errors to [`prepare_context`](@ref): 

```@example 1
ctx = prepare_context(x, y_obs, peaks_info, estimated_error)
```

!!! note

    `estimated_error` is an positional argument that will be set to an array of 1 if you do not pass a vector. It is advised to pass proper errors for a proper scaling of the misfit function.

From there, a good thing is to check that your prior model is not too remote from a good fit. The algorithms we use are local optimization methods and do not aim at finding a global minimum, but only local solutions. If you set ``m_{prior}`` to values far from the solution, they will fail. To check your starting parameters, we can fit the prior model and the data using:

```@example 1
p = plot_fit(ctx, title="Prior model")
savefig("fit_2.svg"); nothing #hide
```
![](fit_2.svg)

Modify your starting parameters until the model starts to make sense, and then perform a fit calling [`fit_peaks`](@ref) with your favorite backend. For instance, if you want to use IPNewton, call:

```julia
result = fit_peaks(ctx, backend=:Optim)
```

or if you want to use the quasi-Newton method described above, call:


```julia
result = fit_peaks(ctx, backend=:qGN, maxiter=100, relax=5)
```

`result` is an object containing:
- `context::FitContext`: Fit context
- `peak_results::Vector`: Peak results
- `params::Vector{Float64}`: Peak parameters with uncertainties
- `covariance::Matrix{Float64}`: Covariance matrix
- `errors::Vector{Float64}`: 1-sigma standard errors on parameters
- `y_calc::Vector{Float64}`: Model predictions
- `residuals::Vector{Float64}`: Residuals

In `result.peal_results`, numbers are now Measurements as we use the [Measurements.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl) library to automatically propagate fitting errors for peak area calculations. 

After a fit, you can print the parameters and peak areas using [`print_params`](@ref) and plot the fit using [`plot_fit`](@ref). Let's do the fit and those steps below

```@example 1
result = fit_peaks(ctx, backend=:Optim, maxiter=100, relax=10) # hide
print_params(result.peak_results)

plot_fit(ctx, result.peak_results)
savefig("fit_3.svg"); nothing #hide
```
![](fit_3.svg)

## Errors on peak parameters

###  Errors provided by `fit_peaks`

The errors provided by `fit_peaks` come from the evaluation of the Hessian matrix at the optimal point. In the quasi-Newton algorithm, we directly calculate the posterior model covariance matrix as (Tarantola, 2005, eq. 3.53):

```math
C_{M, post} = C_{M} - C_{M}G^{t}(G C_M G{t} +C_D)^{-1}G C_M
```

and retrieve the standard errors on model parameters from the squared root of the diagonal of ``C_{M, post}``. In the IPNewton case, we use ForwardDiff.hessian() to calculate the Hessian matrix at the optimal point to optain ``C_{M, post}``.

!!! note

    Do not neglect off-diagonal terms in ``C_{M, post}``. Peak parameters often are strongly correlated, and neglecting off-diagonal terms may lead to report wrong errors on quantities that depends on several peak parameters, such as peak areas. This is why we automatically propagate errors using ``C_{M, post}`` and Measurements.jl when calculating peak areas in `fit_peaks` for instance.

### Checking errors with bootstrapping

``C_{M, post}`` may not necessarily contain valid parameter uncertainties, particularly if the problem is strongly non-linear.

To check for parameter errors, one option is to use [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)).
[`bootstrap`](@ref) allows us to bootstrap a spectrum and refit the model on the spectrum subsamples. You will obtain samples of models all adjusted on slightly different data. Using the model samples, we can check that the errors calculated from the Hessian are valid, or if they are not, we can use the new errors calculated from the bootstrap samples.

The interface is easy, similar to that of `fit_peaks` but the fit context is defined internally so 
you don't even have to worry about that. For instance, using the quasi-Newton method, we can do: 

```@example 1
boot_params, boot_results = bootstrap(x, y_obs, estimated_error, peaks_info, nb_boot = 50, backend=:Optim);
nothing # hide
```
!!! tip

    The quasi-Newton algorithm is the quickest so you may prefer this one for bootstrapping. If so, you can try also setting maxiter to a value as small as possible without affecting fit convergence. Another tip is to provide a new `peaks_info` vector with ``m_{prior}`` set to the values of a good fit that you previously did.

!!! tip

    Here we only used 50 bootstraps for the sake of generating the documentation in a reasonable time. In practice, you should use more bootstraps (e.g. 1000) to get a good estimate of the errors.

The `bootstrap` function returns:
- a matrix of size (`nb_params`, `nb_boot`) with the fitted parameters (here `boot_params`);
- a peak_results objects with values tied to their errors thanks to Measurements.jl (here called `boot_results`).

We can now print the bootstrapped results and compare the errors with those previously calculated from the Hessian:

```@example 1
print_params(boot_results)
```

OK, actually for this example, we see that the errors from the boostrap analysis
are close to those calculated from the Hessian matrix. Everything thus seems OK.

Of course, a final quick visual inspection is always nice. This can be done by passing the 
median of the matrix of bootstrapped parameters to the plot_fit function:

```@example 1
plot_fit(ctx, boot_results)
savefig("fit_4.svg"); nothing #hide
```
![](fit_4.svg)

### Bayesian MCMC fit with Turing.jl

The same problem can be tackled using Turing.jl and the peak shape functions from Spectra as follow. 
This offers another way to check that the estimated errors are good for instance, or to use different types of 
prior probability distributions on model parameters (as in the quasi-Newton we assume Gaussian priors).

You will need to install Turing.jl, which is not a dependency of Spectra. 
The code below runs well but it may not be fully optimized. It is just for the sack of example. 

Run it on your own computer! If you have suggestions, do not hesitate!

```julia
using Turing

# Define a Bayesian model with priors
@model function bayesian_peaks(x, y)
    # Define priors based on peak_types

    # PEAK 1
    amplitude ~ truncated(Normal(10.016, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)
    center ~ Normal(34.92, 0.5)
    width ~ truncated(Normal(10.0, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)

    Î¼ = gaussian(x, [amplitude, center, width])
    
    # PEAK 2
    amplitude2 ~ truncated(Normal(14.9, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)
    center2 ~ Normal(55.0, 0.5)
    width2 ~ truncated(Normal(3.0, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)
    
    Î¼2 = lorentzian(x, [amplitude2, center2, width2])
    
    # PEAK 3
    amplitude3 ~ truncated(Normal(25.5, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)
    center3 ~ Normal(43.0, 10.0)
    width3 ~ truncated(Normal(2.0, 0.5), 0.0, Inf)
    lr ~ truncated(Normal(0.39, 0.03), 0.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate model prediction
    Î¼3 = pseudovoigt(x, [amplitude3, center3, width3, lr])
    
    # Likelihood
    Ï ~ truncated(Normal(0.2, 0.03), 0.001, Inf)
    y ~ MvNormal(Î¼ + Î¼2 + Î¼3, Ï^2 * I)
end

chain = sample(bayesian_peaks(x_fit, y_fit), NUTS(), 2000, nchains=3, progress=true)
```
